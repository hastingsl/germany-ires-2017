### Lucas Gonzalez
Hallo! I just finished my junior year at UCF majoring in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. I can't wait to start doing research on the storytelling system and experience German culture. When I'm not coding or doing school work, I like to play ukulele, build robots, and play video games.

### Lauren Hastings
Bonjour! I'm a junior at UCF majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. During the school year, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in UCF's Intelligent Systems Lab. My current work involves using machine learning to detect irregular driving in teenagers with ADHD. I'm very excited to learn about German culture and conduct storytelling research! When I'm not writing proofs or code, I like to make/eat interesting food, read, and play board/video games.


### Vera Kazakova
Всем привет! I'm a UCF Computer Science PhD student under the direction of Dr. Annie S. Wu. My focus is on Multi-Agent Systems and Evolutionary Computation. I am also a GTA for Computer Science II and have previously TAed Intro to Discrete Structures. I'm taking the Summer off from my usual duties and embarking on this fAIble-lous story-telling generation adventure. I'm looking forward to creating some exciting AI, as well as seeing more of Germany and rest of Europe.

### Andres Posadas
Hola! My name is Andres Posadas and I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
I am currently employed by Orlando Utilities Commission as a Salesforce front-end developer. I have also worked as an SI Leader for COP 3223 and COP 3502 at UCF, as well as a Teaching Assistant for COP 3502. Learning about new cultures and exploring new locations has always been a passion of mine, making this research project a perfect opportunity for me. Aside from coding and learning, I enjoy reading, playing guitar and piano, exercising, working on cars, and playing video games.
