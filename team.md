Hi! I'm a junior at UCF majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. During the school year, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in UCF's Intelligent Systems Lab. I'm very excited to learn about German culture and conduct storytelling research! When I'm not writing proofs or code, I like to make/eat interesting food, read and play board/video games.
