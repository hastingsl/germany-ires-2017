### Lauren Hastings
Hi! I'm a junior at UCF majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. During the school year, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in UCF's Intelligent Systems Lab. I'm very excited to learn about German culture and conduct storytelling research! When I'm not writing proofs or code, I like to make/eat interesting food, read and play board/video games.

### Andres Posadas
Guten Tag! My name is Andres Posadas and I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida.
I am currently employed by Orlando Utilities Commission as a Salesforce front-end developer. I have also worked as an SI Leader for COP 3223 and COP 3502 at UCF, as well as a Teaching Assistant for COP 3502. Learning about new cultures and exploring new locations has always been a passion of mine, making this research project a perfect opportunity for me. Aside from coding and learning, I enjoy reading, playing guitar and piano, excercising, working on cars, and playing video games.
