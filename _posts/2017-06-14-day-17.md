Today was like any workday.<!--excerpt--> We've decided to start skipping breakfast at the hostel and pick it up at the cafeteria in Ilmenau instead, which gives us a little bit of extra sleep in the mornings.

In terms of work, today was pretty productive. Everyone set up git to replace SVN and our sub-teams each set up branches for our respective components. Vera and I finished a vast majority of the database content and Lucas started work on a script to automate linking story elements in the database. Vera also finished the collection of character actions and events, our most complex collection which took painstaking work. Andres and Lucas committed their complete testing module for SimpleNLG, and Andres finished work on the prepositional phrase generator. I worked on creating the Java project skeleton and started making classes that correspond to the database collections.

Despite all of the time we spend traveling, it feels like we finally have a routine for our days and we're on schedule for our work this week.
