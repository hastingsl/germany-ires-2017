title:  "Berlin Weekend"

We spent this weekend in Berlin! <!--excerpt--> We took a train for about 4 hours Saturday morning to Berlin Central Station. We had lunch at an interesting Peter-Pan themed burger joint and took another train to Potsdam to see the Sanssouci Palace, the Rococo-styled summer palace of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The palace and surrounding gardens were absolutely beautiful!

After Potsdam, we stopped by our hotel and did an Alpine-cabin themed escape room for team-building. Since our hotel was so far from the escape room and train station, we got to familiarize ourselves with Berlin's subway system.

Sunday, we checked out of our hotel and went to the Mauerpark flea market for food and shopping. We did another dungeon-style escape room in the afternoon (right by Checkpoint Charlie), followed by a very long walk through Tiergarten, Berlin's equivalent of New York's Central Park. Around it, we saw the Reichstag Building, Brandenburg Gate, and the Victory Column.

After all of the walking, we had our dinner at the train station and headed back to Erfurt. We got in around midnight, but given how little sleep we usually get, it wasn't that bad. We're all looking forward to work next week and Prague next weekend!
