After two exciting weekends, we had a pretty chill Saturday. We did some shopping at a local thrift shop and had Italian for lunch. We spent most of the afternoon and early evening working on the project. Lucas and Andres are investigating fuzzy logic for linguistic variables and Vera and I continued work on the system-- I worked on the program infrastructure, and Vera worked on it's representation in the database.

Since the Erfurt festival is happening all weekend, we went back to cathedral square for music and food, and made a stop in a local park on the way home. Parks usually aren't open in the U.S. that late, so it's a nice change.
