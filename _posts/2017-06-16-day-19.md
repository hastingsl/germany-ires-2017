Today was mostly a continuation of yesterday's work. Vera worked on moving our original MongoDB database of story elements over to Neo4j, and I continued developing the data structures we need for our system. Lucas helped validate database inputs and Andres continued work on sentence generation. We all spent some time devising a plan for how to map adverbs to continuous attributes for richer sentence generation.

In the evening, we tried going to Faust Food (again) and ended up hearing music and following it to the Cathedral square, where we found a little fair ground for the Erfurt town festival! I got to eat currywurst and listen to a lot of old American pop songs performed live by Germans. It was a lot of fun! We even got some good group pictures out of it.
