This weekend, we visited the Buchenwald concentration memorial outside of Weimar.
We visit Weimar once a week and always see the signs for Buchenwald, and since we
knew we should see at least one concentration camp memorial while in
Germany, we figured we'd visit the one right in our backyard.

We took a bus for about fifteen minutes from the Weimar train station to
Buchenwald. The area was somewhat forested, and it amazed me that something so
terrible happened in the middle of all the greenery.

We saw what was left of the camp, the memorials, and museum exhibitions about
the history of the camp. We also saw an incredibly moving art gallery featuring
pieces made by camp survivors.

The experience was not fun; it was difficult to be in the crematorium and the
cellars, but overall I think it was an important part of Germany's past for us
to experience firsthand.
