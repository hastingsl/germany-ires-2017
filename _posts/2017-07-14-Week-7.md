<!--excerpt-->

This Friday, we showed Dr. Gonzalez our first system prototype! The NLG system
generated a short story introduction that introduces the protagonist,
antagonist, and their goals, and the storytelling module generated a short
series of thoughts and actions for a character acquiring a single item. Each
action was then run through the NLG system sentence generator to make a text story.

This week, Lucas read NLG and automated storytelling papers to get some
ideas on how to use descriptors (adverbs and adjectives) creatively. Andres
polished the world state introductions and started working on setting up additional
infrastructure for choosing points in the story to describe aspects of the
characters, locations, items, and actions.

Vera worked on expanding our action network to connect to starting states
and end goals. She also started planning how to add interest-building elements
to the story, such as adding interrupt points where the character can be pushed back
from achieving their goal to create conflict. I worked on writing code to traverse
the action/decision graph to generate the stories.

Next week, we hope to have full stories generated from start state to end goal!
