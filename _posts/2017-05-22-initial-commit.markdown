description: Planning for the summer
---

For the last two months, we've been reading and discussing narrative generation and NLP papers in preparation for our trip. <!--excerpt-->  Today, we finally got to present our proposals for summer work to Dr. Gonzalez, our UCF adviser, and to Dr. Knauf, our adviser at TU Ilmenau, who is currently visiting Florida for a conference. Andres and Lucas presented their plans for using [Simple NLG](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg) to generate text for the stories, and Vera and I presented our plans for infrastructure changes and a story generation algorithm.

Next week, Vera and I will be at the [Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society conference](http://www.flairs-30.info/), where we'll get to see last year's group present their paper (we're sure they'll do a great job!). On the 29th, we'll finally leave for Germany. I couldn't be more excited!
