We left an hour early this morning to work longer today. Andres is continuing his work on generating sentences with SimpleNGL, and Lucas has been helping Vera and I by writing scripts to automate database updates. Vera spent the day investigating using Neo4j, a graph database that meshes well with MongoDB, to represent relationships between our story elements. I continued programming the skeleton for our application- locations, characters, the main driver class, etc.

We got back to the hostel around 8:30 p.m. and didn't step out for dinner until 10. Andres, Lucas and I went on a quest to eat at Faust Food (they're big fans of Goethe here), got there too late to eat, had drinks at an Italian restaurant after realizing they stopped serving from the kitchen late at night, and settled on McDonalds on the way home.

But! Tomorrow is Friday, and we're looking forward to good German food and fun!
