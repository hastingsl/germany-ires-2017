Welcome! This blog details the experiences of [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu) Students abroad as part of the [National Science Foundation International Research Experience for Students](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12831) program. We'll be conducting research at the [University of Ilmenau, University of Technology](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/international/) in Ilmenau, Germany under the direction of German and UCF researchers.

Continuing the work of [last year's research group](https://ires2016.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/first-blog-post/), PhD student Vera Kazakova and undergraduates Andres Posadas, Lucas Gonzalez and myself-- Lauren Hastings, will be developing a system that uses techniques in Artificial Intelligence to dynamically generate fictional narratives for children. You can check out the Team tab for more about us.

This blog isn't just for our research progress, however-- expect many posts about life in Germany and our travels in Europe.

Enjoy!

-- Lauren
